<h1>Smart Healthcare Monitoring System in IoT Cloud</h1>

:globe_with_meridians:The Internet of Things (IoT) is essential in innovative applications such as smart cities,
smart homes, education, healthcare, transportation, and defense operations. IoT 
applications are particularly beneficial for providing healthcare because they enable secure
and real-time remote patient monitoring to improve the quality of peopleâ€™s lives. This
review paper explores the latest trends in healthcare-monitoring systems by implementing 
the role of the IoT. The work discusses the benefits of IoT-based healthcare systems
with regard to their significance, and the benefits of IoT healthcare. We provide a 
systematic review on recent studies of IoT-based healthcare-monitoring systems through
literature review. The literature review compares various systemsâ€™ effectiveness,efficiency, data protection, privacy, security, and monitoring. 
The paper also explores wireless- and wearable-sensorbased IoT monitoring systems and provides a classification of healthcare-monitoring sensors. We also elaborate, in detail, on the challenges
and open issues regarding healthcare security and privacy, and QoS. Finally, 
suggestions and recommendations for IoT healthcare applications are laid down at the end of
the study along with future directions related to various recent technology trends.

:technologist:
Our project is a working model which incorporates sensors to measure parameters
like body temperature, heart beat rate.An Arduino microcontroller board is used for
analyzing the inputs from the patient Temperature, heartbeat. 

:hospital:
This project provides a device which will continuously monitor the vital parameters to be monitored for
a patient.If any critical situation arises in a patient, this unit also raises an alarm.
This is very useful for future analysis and review of patientâ€™s health condition. For
more versatile medical applications, this project can be improvised, by incorporating
dental sensors and annunciation systems, thereby making it useful in hospitals as a
very efficient and dedicated patient care system. In recent years, the world is facing a
common problem that the number of elderly people is increasing. Hence, the problem of
home-care for elderly people is very important.In this,IoT is becoming a major platform
for many services applications, also using Node MCU not just as a sensor node but
also a controller here. Paper proposes a generic health monitoring system as a step
forward to the progress made in this department till now.

<h2>ESP3266</h2>
The ESP32 is a dual-core microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection, making it the perfect choice for Internet of Things applications that need both wireless technologies.<br>
It contains a 512 KB RAM and a 32-bit LX6 microcontroller with a maximum clock speed of 240 MHz. I2C, SPI, UART, and GPIO are just a few of the peripheral interfaces the ESP32 offers. It also supports a number of different protocols like CAN and Ethernet.<br>
<h2>Arduino</h2>
The Arduino ecosystem is comprised of a diverse combination of hardware and software.
The versatility of Arduino and its simple interface makes it a leading choice for a wide range of users around the world from 
hobbyists<br> 
designers<br>
artists to product prototypes<br>
<h3>Arduino IDE</h3>
The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is the main text editing program used for Arduino programming. 
It is where youâ€™ll be typing up your code before uploading it to the board you want to program. 
Arduino code is referred to as sketches.

<h4>Arduino Code libraries</h4>
Library Structure<br>
A library is a folder comprised of files with C++ (.cpp) code files and C++ (.h) header files.<br>
The .h file describes the structure of the library and declares all its variables and functions.<br>
The .cpp file holds the function implementation.<br>

<h4>Importing Libraries</h4>
The first thing you need to do is find the library you want to use out of the many libraries available online. After downloading it to your computer, you just need to open Arduino IDE<br>
click on Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries. 
You can then select the library that you want to import into the IDE. Once the process is complete the library will be available in the sketch menu.<br>
In the code provided by circuito.io instead of adding external libraries like mentioned before, we provide them with the firmware folder.
In this case, the IDE knows how to find them when using #include.<br>

From Software to Hardware<br>
.<br>
There is a lot to be said of Arduinoâ€™s software capabilities, but itâ€™s important to remember that the platform is comprised of both software and hardware. 
<br>
The two work in tandem to run a complex operating system.
